			<p>As a part web application programming and hacking course for lab 0 - development Environment setup , 
			I have completed the setup of Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine using the Sandbox and installed the softwares 
			as mentioned which include apache2, github, pandoc, sublime-text and chrome. Apart from this i have 
			created git private repository on github and have shared it with instructor,generated SSH keys ,
			cloned repostory into local machine. Lab0 execises has been performed and READMe.md file has been edited as per professor instructions.</p>

			<p>This lab explores more into the web application development with front-end. As a part of Lab 1 , I understood how to analyze the network packets in a wireshark tool based on the HTTP requests and the HTTP responses with TELNET and compared them with the browser sent requests. Within the Part 2 of Lab 1 i have learned how CGI works and done hand-ons on CGI applications in C and HTML . Apart from this PHP web application development was also covered as a part of this lab. In part 3, got familiarized with HTTP GET and POST requests using the wireshark tool and curl. After all the respective screenshots have been captured and inserted, content has been written in markdown format pandoc tool was used to generate pdf file.</p>

			<p>This lab delves deeper into front-end web application development. In connection with Lab 2, I understood how to develop a web application using few basic HTML tags and javasrcipt by inlcuding images and forms and created a HTTP GET and POST request and further analyzed the the request, response, status code through the inspect element. After that Ajax , CSS and Jquery has been used to enhance the web application and make the code easy. . The pandoc tool was used to create the PDF file after all relevant screenshots had been taken and added, and the content had been prepared in markdown.</p>

			<h3> Hackathon 1</h3>

			<p>I have gained extensive knowledge about XSS attacks and defense in this Hackathon by increasing the code standards in each level. I enjoyed learning how to render the encoded input to the web page at different phases of Task 1's practical implementation of the attacks, and I also investigated the importance of the encoded function in preventing injections. In Task 2, the focus was primarily on defense, with an emphasis on input validation in various files that are already present in lab1 and lab2(i.e .php,.js and .html), nullifying null values, and encoding input to prevent website hacking. The pandoc tool was used to create the PDF file after all relevant screenshots had been taken and added, and the content had been prepared in markdown.</p>
