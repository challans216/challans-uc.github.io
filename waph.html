			<p>This lab explores more into the web application development with front-end. As a part of Lab 1 , I understood how to analyze the network packets in a wireshark tool based on the HTTP requests and the HTTP responses with TELNET and compared them with the browser sent requests. Within the Part 2 of Lab 1 i have learned how CGI works and done hand-ons on CGI applications in C and HTML . Apart from this PHP web application development was also covered as a part of this lab. In part 3, got familiarized with HTTP GET and POST requests using the wireshark tool and curl. After all the respective screenshots have been captured and inserted, content has been written in markdown format pandoc tool was used to generate pdf file.</p>
